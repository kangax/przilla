# Recent Changes

- **Mobile Log Score Drawer (Apr 19, 2025):**

  - **Goal:** Enable mobile users to log scores via a native-feeling, accessible bottom sheet.
  - **Investigation:** Multiple attempts to use a previous bottom sheet library failed due to deep incompatibilities with React 18/Next.js and peer dependency issues. Dynamic and static imports, as well as minimal usage, all resulted in runtime errors.
  - **Implementation:** Switched to shadcn/ui's Drawer (vaul-based), generating the component and integrating it into the mobile WOD list. The Drawer is controlled via state, displays a contextual title, and renders the shared LogScoreForm for the selected WOD.
  - **Outcome:** The "Log Score" button in mobile view now opens a robust, accessible Drawer for logging scores. The Drawer closes on submit or cancel, and the UI is visually consistent with the app's design system. All previous issues with third-party bottom sheet libraries are resolved.

- **Added 23 New Benchmark WODs to JSON and Database (Apr 18, 2025):**

  - **Goal:** Expand the set of benchmark/skill-based WODs tracked in the system.
  - **Implementation:**
    - Added 23 new benchmark/skill WODs (e.g., Handstand Push-Ups: Max Reps, L-Sit Hold: Max Time, Pull-up (Weighted): 1RM, etc.) to `public/data/wods.json` using a Node.js script.
    - Created a dedicated script (`scripts/add_new_wods_to_db.ts`) to insert only these new WODs into the database, mapping all fields to the schema and using `onConflictDoNothing` to avoid duplicates.
    - The script was updated to use `TURSO_DATABASE_URL` and `TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN` from `.env` for production DB access.
    - All new WODs are now present in both the JSON file and the Turso production database.
  - **Outcome:** The system now tracks a broader set of skill/benchmark WODs, with all data synchronized between static JSON and the production database. Scripts are in place for future batch additions.

- **Log/Edit Score Dialog: Correct Timecap Radio Default in Edit Mode (Apr 17, 2025):**

  - **Goal:** Ensure the "Finished within timecap?" radio group in `LogScoreDialog.tsx` correctly defaults to "Yes" or "No" based on the score being edited when opening the dialog in edit mode for a timecapped WOD.
  - **Implementation:**
    - Updated `src/app/(main)/components/LogScoreDialog.tsx`:
      - Modified the `useEffect` hook that handles `initialScore`.
      - Added logic to check if the `wod` has a `timecap`.
      - If it does, set the `finishedWithinTimecap` state to `'yes'` if `initialScore.time_seconds` is not null, and `'no'` otherwise.
    - Created `src/app/(main)/components/LogScoreDialog.test.tsx`:
      - Added Vitest/React Testing Library tests to verify the radio group defaults correctly in edit mode for both time-based and reps/rounds-based scores on timecapped WODs.
      - Added a test to ensure the radio group does not appear for non-timecapped WODs.
      - Included necessary mocks for tRPC and Radix UI Theme/Portal.
  - **Outcome:** When editing a score for a timecapped WOD, the dialog now correctly pre-selects the timecap completion status based on the existing score data, improving the user experience. The new tests ensure this behavior is maintained.

- **Log/Edit Score Dialog: Horizontal Reps/Rounds Layout (Apr 17, 2025):**

  - **Goal:** Improve the layout density of the score logging/editing form (`LogScoreDialog.tsx`) by placing the Reps, Rounds, and Partial Reps input fields on a single horizontal line when applicable.
  - **Implementation:**
    - Updated `src/app/(main)/components/LogScoreDialog.tsx`:
      - Wrapped the conditional `Box` components for Reps, Rounds, and Partial Reps inputs within a parent `Flex` component (`direction="row"`, `gap="2"`, `align="end"`).
      - This parent `Flex` is only rendered when these fields are relevant (e.g., user hit timecap, or WOD type is AMRAP/ShowAll).
      - Added `style={{ flexGrow: 1 }}` to the inner `Box` components for each input field to ensure they distribute space evenly.
  - **Outcome:** The Reps, Rounds, and Partial Reps input fields now appear horizontally when needed, creating a more compact and visually organized form layout.

- **Timecap-Aware Log/Edit Score UI & Vertical Radio Group (Apr 16, 2025):**

  - **Goal:** Enable robust, user-friendly score logging for timecapped WODs, with clear UI and validation.
  - **Implementation:**
    - Updated `src/app/(main)/components/LogScoreDialog.tsx`:
      - For WODs with a timecap, users are prompted with a vertical Radix UI radio group: "Finished within [timecap] timecap?" with options for "Yes, finished within timecap (enter your time)" and "No, hit the timecap (enter reps or rounds+reps)".
      - The form dynamically shows time or reps/rounds+reps input fields based on the user's selection.
      - Validation ensures that if "Yes" is selected, the entered time must be less than the timecap; if "No" is selected, reps or rounds+reps are required.
      - All UI uses Radix UI primitives for accessibility, theme consistency, and minimalism.
    - Updated `src/types/wodTypes.ts` to include `timecap?: number | null` in the Wod type.
    - Updated `src/app/(main)/components/WodViewer.tsx` to pass the timecap field through to WOD objects.
    - Updated `src/server/api/routers/wod.ts` to return the timecap field in the getAll API.
  - **Outcome:** The log/edit score dialog now fully supports timecapped WODs with a clear, accessible, and minimal UI. Invalid entries are prevented, and the groundwork is laid for future analytics and features.

- **WOD Time Cap Field Added & Backfilled (Apr 16, 2025):**

  - **Goal:** Add a structured `timecap` (seconds, nullable) field to the WODs table in the database and backfill it using real data.
  - **Implementation:**
    - Updated `src/server/db/schema.ts` to add a new `timecap` integer column to the WODs table.
    - Generated and applied a Drizzle migration to update the database schema.
    - Created `scripts/backfill_timecaps.js` to parse and backfill the `timecap` field for 62 WODs using `public/data/wods_with_timecaps.json`.
      - The script parses timecap strings (e.g., "Time Cap: 20", "12 min cap") into seconds.
      - For each WOD, it matches by name and updates the new field.
      - Most WODs matched directly; a few may require manual review for naming mismatches or ambiguous timecap values.
    - Ran the script with the correct environment and database, successfully updating 62 WODs.
  - **Outcome:** The `timecap` field is now present and populated for all WODs with a known time cap. This enables robust score logging, validation, and future analytics based on timecap data.

- **WOD Time Cap Extraction & Structured Data (Apr 16, 2025):**

  - **Goal:** Identify all WODs with a time cap and create a structured dataset for further processing and UI improvements.
  - **Implementation:**
    - Used regex-based search on `public/data/wods.json` to detect time cap patterns in the description field.
    - Extracted all matching WODs (64 total) and created a new file: `public/data/wods_with_timecaps.json`.
    - Each entry includes: `wodName`, the matched `timecap_string`, and the full `description`.
    - This enables review, parsing, and backfilling of a structured `timecap` (seconds) field in the main dataset.
  - **Outcome:** All WODs with a time cap are now easily reviewable and ready for structured data migration. This supports robust score logging logic and future analytics.

- **WOD Table Score Sorting (Apr 16, 2025):**

  - **Goal:** Implement sorting for the "Your Scores" column in the desktop `WodTable` component (`src/app/(main)/components/WodTable.tsx`) based on the calculated performance level of the user's latest score for each WOD.
  - **Implementation:**
    - Updated `src/types/wodTypes.ts`:
      - Added `'results'` to the `SortByType` union type.
    - Updated `src/app/(main)/components/WodTable.tsx`:
      - Defined a constant `performanceLevelValues` mapping levels (Elite, Advanced, Intermediate, Beginner, Rx, Scaled, No Score) to numeric values (4 down to -2) for sorting.
      - Defined a custom TanStack Table `sortingFn` named `sortByLatestScoreLevel` _inside_ the `createColumns` function. This function accesses `scoresByWodId` via closure, finds the latest score for each row, determines its numeric level using `performanceLevelValues` and `getPerformanceLevel` (from `wodUtils`), and compares the levels.
      - Modified the column definition for "Your Scores" (`id: 'results'`):
        - Set `enableSorting: true`.
        - Assigned `sortingFn: sortByLatestScoreLevel`.
        - Made the `header` a clickable `<span>` that calls `handleSort('results')` and displays the sort indicator.
      - Updated the `isValidSortBy` helper function to include `'results'` in its validation array.
      - Removed the unnecessary passing of `scoresByWodId` via `meta` in `useReactTable` options, as the sorting function now uses closure.
  - **Outcome:** The "Your Scores" column in the desktop WOD table is now sortable. Clicking the header toggles sorting based on the performance level of the user's latest score for each WOD (Elite > Advanced > Intermediate > Beginner > Rx > Scaled > No Score).
