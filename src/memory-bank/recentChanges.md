- **Test File Refactoring: Improved Organization and Maintainability**

  - **Goal:** Improve test organization by extracting mocks and test data into separate files, following best practices.
  - **Implementation:**
    - Created a new directory structure for test utilities: `src/server/api/__tests__/utils/`.
    - Extracted mock types to `mockTypes.ts`.
    - Moved context creation logic to `makeCtx.ts`.
    - Separated test data generation into `testData.ts`.
    - Updated `wod.test.ts` to use these new utility files.
    - Fixed TypeScript errors related to `any` types in the test files.
    - Updated the tech memory bank with testing best practices.
  - **Outcome:** Test files are now more maintainable, reusable, and follow best practices for organization. The tech memory bank now includes guidelines for keeping test files small and organized.

- **WodViewer Refactor: Extracted Filter/Sort/Search State to Custom Hook**

  - **Goal:** Reduce the size and complexity of `WodViewer.tsx` by extracting all filter, sort, search, and URL sync logic into a dedicated custom hook, improving maintainability and separation of concerns.
  - **Implementation:**
    - Created a new custom hook `useWodViewerFilters` in `src/app/(main)/components/hooks/useWodViewerFilters.ts`.
    - Moved all state and URL synchronization logic for selected categories, tags, completion filter, sort, sort direction, and search term from `WodViewer.tsx` into the new hook.
    - Updated `WodViewer.tsx` to use the hook, removing the corresponding state and effect logic from the component.
    - Updated all references in `WodViewer.tsx` to use the values and setters returned by the hook.
    - Ensured all derived values (e.g., validSelectedCategories, validSelectedTags) are now provided by the hook.
  - **Outcome:** `WodViewer.tsx` is now significantly smaller and easier to read, with all filter/sort/search state and URL sync logic encapsulated in a reusable, testable hook. This sets the stage for further modularization and refactoring of the component.

- **CSV Import Flow: Zod Migration for Type Guards and Validation**

  - **Goal:** Replace all hand-written type guards and ad-hoc property checks for CSV import with robust, type-safe Zod schemas and validation.
  - **Implementation:**
    - Removed all custom type guards (`isCsvRow`, `isPrzillaCsvRow`) from the codebase.
    - Added Zod schemas for `CsvRow` and `PrzillaCsvRow` in `src/app/import/components/types.ts`.
    - Replaced all usages of the old type guards and all property checks (e.g., `"date" in row`, `"Date" in row`) in the import flow (`useScoreProcessing.ts`, `ScoreReviewTable.tsx`, `ReviewStep.tsx`) with Zod-based type narrowing using `.safeParse`.
    - Updated all relevant logic to use Zod schemas for runtime validation and type inference.
    - Ensured all import-related and UI tests pass after migration, confirming correctness and robustness.
  - **Outcome:** The import flow is now fully Zod-validated, type-safe, and maintainable. This aligns with project patterns, improves runtime safety, and eliminates duplication between TypeScript types and runtime validation logic.

- **WOD Movements Table and Data Population:**
  - **Goal:** Normalize all WOD movements in the database for analytics, filtering, and UI features.
  - **Implementation:**
    - Added `movements` and `wod_movements` tables to the schema (Drizzle ORM).
    - Ran migration and populated these tables in the local/dev database using a robust script (`scripts/populate_movements_to_db.ts`).
    - The script extracts all unique movements from canonical WOD data (`public/data/wods_with_movements.json`) and creates associations for each WOD.
    - Local run: 387 unique movements, 3021 associations, 8 WODs missing in DB (to review).
    - The script is robust, idempotent, and logs all actions.
    - **Production DB is not yet migrated.**
    - **Next step:** Run `drizzle-kit push` with the production `DATABASE_URL` to create the new tables, then run the population script with the same prod URL.
  - **Outcome:** Local database is fully populated with normalized movements and associations. Production migration and data population are pending.
