# System Patterns

## Critical Code Integrity Rule

- **No code or documentation may be omitted, summarized, or replaced with ellipsis or comments indicating omission. All files must always be complete and explicit. This rule is critical for all source code, test files, and documentation, including the memory bank. Summarization, "omitted for brevity", or similar practices are strictly forbidden.**

## System Architecture

- **Framework:** Full-stack Next.js application using the App Router.
- **Language:** TypeScript throughout (frontend and backend).
- **API Layer:** tRPC is used for type-safe API communication between the client and server. API routers are defined in `src/server/api/routers/`.
- **Database Interaction:** Drizzle ORM is used to interact with the database (likely LibSQL/Turso based on `techContext.md`). Schema is defined in `src/server/db/schema.ts`.
- **Authentication:** Better Auth handles user authentication. Configuration is in `src/server/auth.ts`, using the Drizzle adapter. API routes are handled by `src/app/api/auth/[...all]/route.ts`.
- **Client-Side State:** TanStack Query (React Query) manages server state and caching on the client, integrated with tRPC.
- **Component Structure:** React components are organized within `src/app/_components/` and feature-specific directories (e.g., `src/app/import/components/`, `src/components/`).
- **Data Fetching Pattern:** For pages requiring large static datasets on initial load (e.g., the main WOD list on `page.tsx`), data is fetched server-side within the page's Server Component and passed as props to the relevant Client Component (`WodViewer`). The Client Component uses this prop for initial rendering and retains its `useQuery` hook for caching and background updates. User-specific data (e.g., scores) is typically fetched client-side within the Client Component.

## Key Technical Decisions

- **Framework Choice:** Next.js (App Router) chosen for its full-stack capabilities, routing, React Server Components, and React ecosystem integration.
- **API Layer:** tRPC selected for end-to-end type safety between backend and frontend.
- **Database ORM:** Drizzle ORM chosen, likely for its TypeScript focus, performance, and compatibility with edge databases like LibSQL/Turso.
- **Authentication:** Better Auth chosen to replace NextAuth.js, providing authentication services (email/password, social logins) integrated with Drizzle via its adapter.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS used for utility-first styling, combined with Radix UI for accessible, unstyled component primitives.
- **State Management:** TanStack Query (React Query) for managing server state, caching, and data fetching, integrating well with tRPC.
- **Error Handling:** Ensure robust error handling is implemented throughout the application. (From previous rules)
- **Score Badge Colors:** Performance levels are color-coded for quick visual identification:
  - Elite: purple
  - Advanced: green
  - Intermediate: yellow
  - Beginner: gray
  - Rx-only (no level): green

## Design Patterns

_What design patterns are used in the codebase?_

- **Composition over Inheritance:** Prefer composing functionality over using class inheritance.
- **Repository Pattern:** Use the repository pattern for data access layers.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Avoid duplicating logic or data; reuse existing implementations where possible.

## Testing Patterns

- **Element-based Selection Only:** All tests must select elements by unique attributes (such as `data-testid`) and must never match or assert by text content. Matching by text in tests is strictly forbidden. This ensures tests are robust against copy changes, localization, and UI tweaks. All new and existing tests must follow this rule.

## Component Relationships

- **Server -> Client Data Flow:** Server Components (like `src/app/page.tsx`) can fetch data using the server tRPC client (`~/trpc/server`) and pass it as props to Client Components (`src/app/_components/WodViewer.tsx`).
- **Client Data Fetching:** Client Components use tRPC hooks (via `~/trpc/react`) to fetch data from the backend (e.g., user scores in `WodViewer`).
- **API Routing:** The tRPC server (`src/app/api/trpc/[trpc]/route.ts`) routes requests to specific routers defined in `src/server/api/routers/`. The Better Auth API handler (`src/app/api/auth/[...all]/route.ts`) manages auth-specific routes.
- **Database Interaction:** Routers interact with database logic (potentially using the Repository Pattern, as preferred) likely located within or called from the routers, using Drizzle ORM (`src/server/db/`).
- **Authentication:** Authentication state is managed by Better Auth (`src/server/auth.ts`). Server-side access via `getSession` (`~/server/auth.ts`), client-side access via `useSession` (`~/lib/auth-client.ts`).

## Critical Implementation Paths

- **Database Migration:** Moving from static JSON to a dynamic, user-specific database (Drizzle + LibSQL/Turso) is a critical and complex task involving schema design, data migration, and updating all data access logic (tRPC routers, etc.). The auth schema migration from NextAuth to Better Auth was part of this.
- **Authentication Integration:** Ensuring Better Auth correctly protects user data and integrates seamlessly with the database (via Drizzle adapter) and tRPC (via context).
- **Data Import/Scraping:** Implementing reliable data import from external sources (Wodwell, SugarWod) involves handling different formats, potential API limitations, and error conditions.
- **Stats/Analysis Engine:** Developing the logic for calculating and displaying meaningful user statistics could become complex depending on the desired insights.
- **CSV Import Processing:** Score import from CSV uses client-side parsing (`papaparse`) and matching against WOD data fetched via tRPC. This avoids server load for parsing but requires fetching all WODs to the client for matching. **Note:** The initial WOD fetch for matching might be optimizable now that `page.tsx` fetches WODs server-side.

## Workout Difficulty & Benchmark Estimation Heuristics

### Overview

Our system uses AI reasoning combined with heuristic rules to analyze workout descriptions and infer:

- **Difficulty rating** (Easy, Medium, Hard, Very Hard, Extremely Hard)
- **Difficulty explanation** (concise rationale)
- **Benchmark levels** (elite, advanced, intermediate, beginner) in seconds or reps

This enables consistent, scalable enrichment of new workouts.

---

### Key Factors Considered

- **Workout Format:**
  - **Monostructural** (run, row, bike): difficulty primarily based on distance/time domain; benchmarks well-established (e.g., 5k run, 2k row)
  - **Couplets/Triplets:** difficulty depends on load, skill, and volume
  - **Chippers/Pyramids:** longer duration, high volume, often higher difficulty
  - **AMRAPs:** difficulty varies widely; depends on movement mix, duration, and skill
  - **Max load:** difficulty based on % of Rx
  - **Partner/Team:** often increases volume but allows rest; difficulty depends on work/rest ratio
- **Movement Types:**
  - High-skill gymnastics (muscle-ups, HSPU, pistols) → increase difficulty
  - Heavy barbell/dumbbell loads → increase difficulty
  - Simpler movements (air squats, sit-ups) → lower difficulty unless volume is extreme
- **Volume:**
  - Total reps/time cap
  - High volume (e.g., 150+ reps) → higher difficulty
- **Load:**
  - Near maximal weights (e.g., 275lb+ cleans) → very high difficulty
- **Complexity:**
  - Multiple high-skill elements combined → very high difficulty
  - Simple couplets/triplets with light loads → lower difficulty

### Difficulty Rating Heuristics

| Rating         | Typical Features                                               |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Easy           | Bodyweight only, low volume, no complex skills                 |
| Medium         | Moderate volume, light-moderate loads, basic skills            |
| Hard           | High volume OR moderate skill/heavy load                       |
| Very Hard      | Heavy loads + high skill + high volume                         |
| Extremely Hard | Maximal loads, multiple high-skill elements, or extreme volume |

### Difficulty Explanation Generation

- Concise summary of **why** the workout is challenging
- References:
  - Load (e.g., "heavy dumbbells")
  - Skill (e.g., "strict HSPU")
  - Volume (e.g., "high volume GHD sit-ups")
  - Format (e.g., "fast-paced 10-minute cap")

**Example:**
_"Strict HSPU, heavy dumbbells, and double-unders in a fast-paced 10-minute cap"_

---

### Benchmark Level Estimation

- **Time-based workouts:**
  - Convert minutes to seconds (e.g., 10 min cap = 600 sec)
  - Elite: 60-80% of cap
  - Advanced: 80-90%
  - Intermediate: 90-100%
  - Beginner: unable to finish or just finish cap
- **AMRAPs:**

  - **Note:** AMRAP benchmarks vary **dramatically** based on workout specifics.
  - Influencing factors:
    - Workout duration (short sprints vs 40+ min grinds)
    - Movement difficulty (e.g., muscle-ups vs air squats)
    - Rep scheme complexity (single movement vs multi-modal chipper)
    - Expected pacing and fatigue factors
    - Presence of heavy loads or complex skills
  - Examples from 100 workout analysis:
    - Short/simple AMRAPs: elite = 7-10 rounds
    - Long chipper AMRAPs: elite = 3-5 rounds
    - High-rep AMRAPs: elite = 200-450 reps
    - EMOM/interval AMRAPs: elite = fixed rounds (e.g., 4 of 4)
  - Always tailor benchmarks based on the specific workout's structure and typical athlete performances.
  - Avoid applying a single reps/rounds heuristic universally.
  - Example rough ranges for a **typical 15-20 minute mixed-modal AMRAP**:
    - Elite: 5+ rounds or 200+ reps
    - Advanced: 4-5 rounds
    - Intermediate: 3-4 rounds
    - Beginner: 1-3 rounds

- **Load-based workouts:**

  - Use absolute weights (e.g., 185lb Bear Complex) or % of Rx
  - Elite often near Rx or above
  - Advanced ~80-90% Rx
  - Intermediate ~60-80% Rx
  - Beginner <60% Rx

- **Partner/Team workouts:**
  - Often lack strict benchmarks due to rest intervals
  - Difficulty depends on work/rest ratio and total volume
  - Use caution when estimating benchmarks; may require manual review
- **Max load:**
  - Elite: 90-100% Rx
  - Advanced: 80-90%
  - Intermediate: 70-80%
  - Beginner: <70%

### Edge Cases & Notes

- **Partner WODs:** Difficulty depends on rest/work ratio. Benchmarks often missing or less standardized (e.g., "Faas Fit", "Holloway", "Horton").
- **Complex scoring (e.g., max load + AMRAP):** May require multi-part benchmarks or lack standard levels (e.g., "Dragon").
- **Missing data:** Some workouts (e.g., "DRK", "Chief John Sing", "FF Alex Graham", "Goose", "Harvell") lack benchmark data. Use conservative estimates or flag for manual review.
- **EMOMs:** Benchmarks often based on completing all rounds (e.g., Chelsea) or total reps/calories (e.g., Death By Assault).
- **Card-based/Random:** Workouts like "Deck of Death" have variable difficulty based on luck. Benchmarks represent averages.
